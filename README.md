# Medium Unlocked

**Medium Unlocked** is a userscript that adds alternate reading links (ReadMedium and Freedium) to Medium paywalled or member-only articles. It helps readers access content through public mirror services when Medium blocks full access.

> ⚠️ This script is intended for educational or accessibility purposes. Always respect content creators and platform terms of service.

## ✨ Features

- Automatically detects Medium paywalled/member-only stories
- Adds two external reading links directly on the page:
  - 🔗 [ReadMedium](https://readmedium.com)
  - 🔗 [Freedium](https://freedium.cfd)
- Lightweight, fast, and works on all Medium subdomains

- 🔗 [Install via GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/YOUR-SCRIPT-ID) _(once published)_
- Or manually install from [medium-unlocked.user.js](https://github.com/ShrekBytes/medium-unlocked/raw/main/medium-unlocked.user.js)

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Script runs on any `medium.com` or `*.medium.com` page
2. If a member-only/paywalled article is detected, it injects:
    - A “ReadMedium” button
    - A “Freedium” button
3. Buttons open the same article via those public mirrors in a new tab
