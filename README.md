## Overview

**Medium Unlocked** is a lightweight userscript that detects paywalled ("member-only") articles on Medium and provides alternate reading links using external services — [ReadMedium](https://readmedium.com) and [Freedium](https://freedium.cfd).

---

## Features

- Detects Medium paywalls automatically
- Adds ReadMedium & Freedium buttons
- Simple, fast, and privacy-respecting
- Supports Medium's dynamic page loads (SPA)

---

## Usage

Once installed, visit any [Medium](https://medium.com) article.  
If the article is paywalled, you’ll see **"ReadMedium"** and **"Freedium"** buttons appear near the right side of the page.  
Clicking them will open the same article via an alternate reader.

---

## Installation

1. Install a userscript manager like [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/).
2. [Click here to install the script](https://github.com/ShrekBytes/medium-unlocked/raw/main/medium-unlocked.user.js).
3. Done! Visit Medium and enjoy unrestricted reading links.

## Notes

- This script **does not bypass** paywalls directly.
    
- It only links to third-party services.
    
- Use at your own discretion.
